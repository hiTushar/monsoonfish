## Remarks   
- for charts, I have used Chart.js library   
- for calendar, react-calendar library   
- all style is done using just css. 

## Task    
Part 1

•Create a calendar using React

•Add the bank holiday list to the calendar. So when we look at any month of 2023 we should see the holidays marked out. Clicking on them should provide some basic info about the holiday.

•Give the user the ability to add additional holidays to the calendar. Add a button that on click will add a Holiday on the selected date (persist the data in local storage).

 

Part 2 **

Make a line chart just like the below charts (Graph design).

You can have more than one line in the chart with random data.

A fill of some gradient color would be considered a plus point.

**code in tsx will be a bonus.

 

Other details:

You can use a js library / build the above-mentioned from scratch.

You can make as many changes as possible, show your creativity, and make it visually appealing.

•Comment your code. Indent it well.

•Put the references or web links used to create that section within the code comments. So if you use some online tutorial for making calendar and graph, put it in.

•The idea is to see your logic and quality of code and the understanding of aesthetics and design.
